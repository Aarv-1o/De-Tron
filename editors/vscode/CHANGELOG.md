# Changelog

## 0.0.7

- A quieter sidebar: one bar showing the mix of problems instead of four boxes, findings as dense rows (a shape per severity, the title in full, the code and its location below), Copy fix in place of the location on hover, tabs instead of boxed switches, and at most one filled button.

## 0.0.6

- The sidebar in three parts: Findings; Scanning (scan your repo, check automatically on or off, the agent's next check-in as 10 ticks); Your agent (connect Claude Code, suggest or block, how its task is going, live).
- Edits an agent makes on disk trigger a check too, not only saves in the editor.

## 0.0.5

- Faster: scans about 45% quicker, and a save re-checks only the files that changed (about 0.5s on a mid-size repo).

## 0.0.4

- A cleaner sidebar: counts at a glance, file name first, Copy fix on hover, empty groups folded into one line, Scan again / Full report / Copy report in the panel's title bar.
- Says when it can't tell what changed (the open folder isn't a git repo).
- The panel's script nonce comes from crypto, not Math.random() (found by Detron).

## 0.0.3

- Fix: the extension stopped at startup ("command 'detron.toggleShow' already exists"). The server's commands are now detron.server.*.

## 0.0.2

- The Detron sidebar: scan, your changes or the whole repo, findings by part, reports.
- Fix: the server didn't start in VS Code, so the status bar kept spinning.

## 0.0.1

First version: findings in the editor, your changes by default, plain-word cards, safe quick fixes.
